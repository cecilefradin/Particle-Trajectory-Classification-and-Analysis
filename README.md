# Particle-Trajectory-Classification-and-Analysis
Mathematica notebook for classification and analysis of the trajectories of particles detected by the ImageJ Mosaic plugin.

Description: This Mathematica program imports the output file generated by the ImageJ Mosaic Plugin which contain the result of particle tracking, and performs analysis of particle trajectories, in particular step size distribution and MSD analysis.

A sample Mosaic output file (Traj_mamLnew10.csv) is included in this repository.

This program was used to analyze the data in Sun et al., "Cellular distribution and motion of essential magnetosome proteins expressed in mammalian cells".
